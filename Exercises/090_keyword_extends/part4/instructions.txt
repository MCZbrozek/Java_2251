Add a new class that extends Vehicle. This new class can be anything you want. It could be an Airplane or Submarine or other vehicle of your choice.

Write your class to have at least one attribute and method that is not shared by any of the other Vehicles.

Create an instance of your new class in Main and call one of its methods, as well as the honk method that it inherits.
