Rewrite the code in Circle.java and Main.java so that the Circle has a radius instance variable and 5.7 only needs to be used once in the entire program to set the value of the radius.

Delete the unnecessary local variables and parameters once the instance variable is set up.

You may add a constructor to Circle.java or a setter method or both.

Add @Override before the toString method and make sure that the program still compiles.
