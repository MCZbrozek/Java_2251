TODO: Fill in the blanks in the provided Java classes to complete the following exercise:

Write a class that extends thread. The class should take as input an integer to start counting from and a String to use as a name. The run method of the threaded class should print out all the integers from start to 10,000 alongside the thread's name (given as a string input in the constructor).

Main should create two of these threads with different names and start up both of them.

Challenge: see if you can start each thread with a value that makes them finish close to the same time.
The thread you start first is likely to finish before the other thread.
