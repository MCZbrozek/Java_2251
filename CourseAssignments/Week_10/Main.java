answer the following question:

Q1: One of the goals of multi-threading
is to minimize the resource usage, such
as memory and processor cycles. In three
sentences, explain how multi-threaded
code accomplishes this goal. Consider
writing about blocking on I/O, multicore 
machines, how sluggish humans are,
threads compared to processes, etcetera,
and connect these issues to 
multi-threading.

ANSWER - 
Multi-threading minimizes resource usage by utilizing available processing resources on multi-core machines by allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently utilizing idle CPU cycles. This prevents unnecessary waits and maximizes throughput. Compared to separate processes, threads share basically sharing the same memory, which can reduce the overhead of memory allocation and context switching.
