"Java can distinguish between methods with different method signatures. This means that methods within a class can have the same name if they have different parameter lists"

=================== ASSIGNMENT

A Vector is a self-extending array. It grows larger as needed.

You have been given the shell of a Vector class. You need to implement the functions that have "//TODO" in them.

Upload the Vector.java file that contains your implemented Vector. You will be graded on your Vector succeeding at the tests in Main.java and also a reading of the code to verify that your Vector correctly expands as objects are added to it.

=================== GRADING RUBRIC

Pass the tests in Main.java.

Correctly grow your Vector as objects are added to it.
