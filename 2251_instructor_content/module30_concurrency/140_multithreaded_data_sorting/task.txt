Our goal is to create an object-oriented, multi-threaded solution to reading in a set of data from file and sorting it by date.


CHECKPOINTS:

Begin with 
	StringSplit.java
	ReadIntegersExerciseSolution.java
Integrate these files together to read in and split the csv data and display it.

Create a DateValue.java class to hold the data from each row of the file and display it with a toString method. Read in the data into an array of DateValues.

Make DateValue implement Comparable and test this out so that the array of objects can be sorted.

Write a QuicksortThread class that sorts the given array and spawns new threads for further sorting of sub-arrays in a divide and conquer fashion. Only use references to the original array, no copying.
	TestThread.java
	ThreadDemo.java
	Sorter.java
