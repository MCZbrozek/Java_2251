Plato and Socrates are sitting down to dinner, but there is only one knife and one fork at the table. Both utensils are needed in order to eat. Currently it's a free-for-all. Anyone can grab the knife or the fork and neither one has to let it go.

Sometimes they even forget they are holding one of the utensils. The code is a mess!

Your PRIMARY goal is to change the code in Philosopher.java to minimize the number of times the philosophers prevent each other from eating.

Your SECONDARY goal is to change the code in Philosopher.java to minimize the total time it takes the philosophers to finish eating.

Do not change the code in ANY file except Philosopher.java.
