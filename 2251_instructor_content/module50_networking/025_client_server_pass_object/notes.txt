This is a no-GUI version of the book's server example, 
modified to demonstrate sending and receiving non-String data.
Here I pass an integer array though other objects are possible.

It might be neat to make an example where a tuple Object is sent and the first part of the tuple specifies how the second part should be cast.

Object generic_obj = getObject();
if(obj_type.equals("BankAccount")
	BankAccount ba = (BankAccount)generic_obj;
