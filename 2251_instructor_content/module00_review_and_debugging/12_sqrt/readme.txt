Instructor notes: Use this as a brief review of a short Java program and also demonstrate how (and why) to test code in main and then migrate it into a method.

The two Java files currently contain the same code. Talk through the code in SquareRoot.java with students. Then demonstrate how to migrate the code in SquareRootMethod.java into a static method.

Also discuss why methods are useful (flexibility, code reuse, debugging, etcetera).
