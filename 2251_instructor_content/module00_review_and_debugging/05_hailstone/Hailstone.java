/*
The following text comes from the "ThinkJava" book with some additions by the instructor:

	Debugging is like an experimental science: once you have an idea about what is going 	wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then	you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one.
	BUT MORE THAN THAT, writing code from scratch also involves the scientific method: Hypothesis: if I write this code, I will get that result.
	Write it and test it.
	You should always have an idea of the outcome, even if you're wrong, and sometimes you will be wrong.
	Programming and debugging go hand in hand. Don't just write a bunch of code and then perform trial and error debugging until it all works. Instead, start with a program that does something and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, until the program does what you want.
	That way you will always have a working program, and it will be easier to isolate errors.
