This was originally based on GameMinimal, but GameMinimal is not set up for turn-based code, it's set up for an update method that chooses one action per frame. It was difficult to the point of impossible to implement turn-based movement inside of game minimal so I tore down the house and rebuilt some of it.
This should not be re-merged with GameMinimal, but it's closer to what is needed for some sort of space-clearing game (though is still has a ton of unnecessary content) for such a simple exercise. Maybe it would have been easier to write from scratch. Oh well.

NEXT STEPS: be able to load in different patterns of dots to "eat up" and different levels including walls around the world and among the dots.
