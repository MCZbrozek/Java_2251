- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and barely started on number representations (22 min video): https://cnm.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/cnm/recording/f5beccaae29e103ab9ff6aa696c5c1b8/playback I recorded this in the summer because I had jury duty and I'm reusing it. So the dates in the announcements are not relevant. This covers the entire module 4 powerpoint.

- Number representation complete video (34 min video): https://youtu.be/-rSf4t9TsNE

- Converting from Binary to Decimal and vice versa (20 min video): https://youtu.be/sewbKCXFdhw This video actually goes through the code here: \module04_GUI_SDLC_student\300_number_conversion_SDLC_example\

NOTE: A great metaphor to use in the powerpoint slides for the radix notation is money. Decimal only has dollars in ones, tens, hundreds, and coins in dimes, pennies, (and I suppose tenth pennies). Binary on the other hand has dollars in ones, twos, fours, eights, and so on, and coins in half-dollars, quarters, eights, and so on.
TODO: It would be nice to modify slide 15 here to be "You have 4 digits to work with and can represent any 4 digit number from -0.9999 to 0.9999 and also any one digit signed exponent from -9 to 9" and then discuss capabilities and limitations of the representation.
