The code in GradeBook.java has been changed to introduce four bugs.
Two bugs cause errors to be thrown and the other two just cause the output to be incorrect. Correct output is shown below.

Fix each of the bugs and note the change you made with a comment formatted like the following and a brief description of what change fixed the bug. For instance:
	double x; //FIX: Changed variable type from int to double
or as another example:
	i = i+1; //FIX: Added line of code to increase i so the loop eventually ends.

For partial credit, if you cannot figure out how to fix one of the bugs, write a comment beginning with //BUG: and followed by a description of what affect the bug has.
