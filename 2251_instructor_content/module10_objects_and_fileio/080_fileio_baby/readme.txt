Originally I copied the code from the unemployment data and demonstrated in front of students how to convert that code to work on the baby name data, but I have not found time to do so in subsequent semesters. So the given code just shows the working version.

Stats to consider calculating:
	trending up
	trending down
	most top 3 appearances
